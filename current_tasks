Delete all current implementation (as of 05, JUNE, 2025)
Create new .c files each for a specific task:
    -- tasks_create.c
        -- create a task struct that has these variables:                                                   DONE
            -- id  - size_t (skip negative value check)                                                     DONE
            -- title - char string - short lenght, no spaces                                                DONE
            -- description - char string, start with buffer size 200, later implement dynamic allocation    DONE
            -- status - use enums (DONE, PENDING, IN_PROCESS)                                               DONE
        -- create a ID generation function to properly increment the Task ID even after restarting the app
            -- current plan - count the "{" and use that as a base of ID generation
        -- test for buffer overflow in Title and Description
    -- tasks_list.c 
        -- if no arguments are passed - list all tasks, otherwise list by ID
            -- implement a check if real integer ID is passed
                -- on later stage add a search by keyword option
    -- tasks_edit.c
        -- at first edit the whole description at once, later add a feature where the text is displayed
           in the input box and you can edit char by char (like in notepad)
    -- tasks_delete.c
        -- if no arguments are passed - warn the user and delete all, otherwise delete by ID
            -- Implement a check if real integer ID is passed, if that ID is within the tasks
