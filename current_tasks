Delete all current implementation (as of 05, JUNE, 2025)
Create new .c files each for a specific task:
    -- tasks_create.c
        -- create a task struct that has these variables:
            -- id  - size_t (skip negative value check)
            -- title - char string - short lenght, no spaces
            -- description - char string, start with buffer size 200, later implement dynamic allocation
            -- status - use enums (DONE, PENDING, IN_PROCESS)
    -- tasks_list.c 
        -- if no arguments are passed - list all tasks, otherwise list by ID
            -- implement a check if real integer ID is passed
                -- on later stage add a search by keyword option
    -- tasks_edit.c
        -- at first edit the whole description at once, later add a feature where the text is displayed
           in the input box and you can edit char by char (like in notepad)
    -- tasks_delete.c
        -- if no arguments are passed - warn the user and delete all, otherwise delete by ID
            -- Implement a check if real integer ID is passed, if that ID is within the tasks
